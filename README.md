# activities-custom
Tiny GNOME Shell extension to replace "Activites" text by an icon

I made this because the Activities Configurator was too much for this simple task.
(https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/358/activities-configurator/) 

I do not plan to upload this on extensions.gnome.org (Should I ?)

## Manual install
To install, simply download as zip and unzip contents in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/activities-custom@RaphaelRochet
